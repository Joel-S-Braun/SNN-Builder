# SNN-Builder
This is the AI builder for The Vault :: Blood Money. I created it in LOVE2D. This lets you build spiking neural networks. To use the networks you've created, you can use the SNN Terminal to integrate the AI into ROBLOX or LOVE2D games primarily, however it should be portable to most Lua based platforms with only minor changes.

This is an example of a SNN that I created using the SNN Builder.
