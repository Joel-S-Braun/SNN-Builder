# SNN-Builder
This is the AI builder for The Vault :: Blood Money. I created it in LOVE2D. This lets you build spiking neural networks. The neurons use a rudimental leaky integrate-and-fire model. In the future I will most likely create another repository/branch which will let you use raw save files to run the SNN without any visualisation (as is present here) however will have more in-depth API for network input/output. It may aso have genetic algorithims.

This is an example of a SNN that I created using the SNN Builder.
